    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an end-to-end protein design workflow using three deep learning networks from the Institute for Protein Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step | Model | Purpose |\n",
    "|------|-------|---------|\n",
    "| 1. **Backbone Generation** | RFD3 | Generate novel protein backbones via diffusion |\n",
    "| 2. **Sequence Design** | MPNN | Design amino acid sequences for the generated backbone |\n",
    "| 3. **Structure Validation** | RF3 | Predict the structure from designed sequence to validate designability |\n",
    "\n",
    "All models are unified through [AtomWorks](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/atomworks) (for both inference and training), relying on Biotite `AtomArray` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes you have the base checkpoints downloaded: `foundry install rfd3 ligandmpnn rf3`. You can also specify the paths directly yourself if you wish. You can register your foundry venv to jupyter with: `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=foundry --display-name \"foundry\"`.\n",
